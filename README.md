# Move Coin Project by Mr.PP

Move Coin (MOVC) is a decentralized, immutable Move-to-Earn protocol. 
Users earn coins by walking or running, without any initial coin supply, 
minting, or airdrops. Every transfer carries a 0.01% fee, collected into a reserve pool 
and redistributed fairly via GPS-based activity logging with anti-replay protection.

## Features
- 21 million fixed supply
- No minting, no airdrop, no centralized admin
- GPS-based movement verification (with optional ZK)
- Claim rewards via signature and off-chain computation
- Burn/mint system for inactive accounts
- Fully open under MIT License
